## My process

- My initial process is to layout is build out from the body of the document first and then place the card on the page.
- Once the background and card are added, I then look to flex box to center the component.
- Once the component is centered, I roughly add all the content to the card to get the basic layout
- Once the basic layout is complete, I start with sizing the image and the adding padding and margins to the inner content.
- I like to use internal card body divs to such as content and header to align text content with in the card.
- Then after I have the UI 90 percent complete, I refactor all sizes to close as spec as possible.
- Once everything looks close, I will add the drop shadow to the card.
- Finally I will double check the mobile dimensions and make specific media query changes if needed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

I leared and brushed off alot of cobwebs on laying out HTML and CSS components because I been studying Javascript. This was good practive to get the HTML and CSS brain activity flowing again.

I also learned how to use responsive design using media queries and rem units where applicatble

### Continued development

I will continue to use frontend mentor as I study frontend development and design. For future development I look to get more into CSS grid for the more advanced layouts and landing page challanges

Understand were to use rem units and were to use static pixel definitions in styling
